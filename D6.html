      /*
      You are about to create your own Task List.
      The user might be able to:
      +- Create new tasks by writing them in a text box and pressing a button to add them
      +- Mark a task as completed by clicking on it. The element should look different when completed
      +- Restore a completed task by clicking on it.
      +- Have a checkbox to show only "non-completed" tasks
      - Add a button to clear the list

      Hints:
      - Create the list elements using the createElement function
      - Add the event to them and pass the event to the function that should handle it
      - Rememeber that from the event you can access to the element that generated it using the .target property
